# React Todo App

This React app implements Redux for state management and Firebase for data persistence. The unit testing is implemented with Karma using the Mocha framework. Social authentication through GitHub is implemented using Firebase.

## Todo List

- [ ] Fully refactor for ES2015 (replacing calls to `require()` with `import`)
- [ ] Add functionality to create user so users without a GitHub account can use app
